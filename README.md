# Changes
Created and tested the triangle algorithm and was used the *Fast, Minimum Storage Ray/Triangle Intersection (MÃ¶ller, T.; Trumbore, B.)*

The first try didn't go very well, but was a point position mistake.

*The speed and memory tests wasn't make yet, we still need the second triangle intersection algotihm to make the comparisions*

Output image rendered can be found in the *Output* folder with the "*Tringle.jpg*

# RT-Template

A very simple C++11 template code for the development of ray tracers.
The template that the project was based on, was created by Christian Pagot:
https://github.com/capagot/RT-Template

# Dependencies

This software depends on the following third party software to be compiled:

- glm version 0.9.7.0 or later (http://glm.g-truc.net).

# Compiling and Running

I've compiled and executed this software only in Linux (Ubuntu 14.04).
These are the steps needed in order to compile the program:

1. Install the dependencies (i.e. glm).
2. Download the source code together with the Makefile.
3. Open the Makefile with a text editor (e.g. vim, gedit, etc.).
4. Configure the variables CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS in order to reflect your glm installations.
5. Save the Makefile.
6. Call 'make DEBUG=0' at the project root directory.
7. Done

To render the hardcoded scene, just issue the following command from the project root directory: 

    $ ./swpathtracer
